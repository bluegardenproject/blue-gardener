# Agent and Skill Metadata Requirements

When creating or editing agent files in `agents/` or skill files in `skills/`, always include the required metadata fields in the YAML frontmatter.

## Required Frontmatter Fields

```yaml
---
name: agent-name
description: Clear description of what the agent does and when to use it
category: category-name
tags: [tag1, tag2, tag3]
---
```

## Field Guidelines

### name
- **Must start with `blue-` prefix** to avoid conflicts in target projects
- Use descriptive names: `blue-{domain}-{specialty}` pattern
- Lowercase letters and hyphens only
- Match the filename (without .md extension)
- Examples:
  - `blue-github-actions-specialist`
  - `blue-react-tailwind-developer`
  - `blue-typescript-code-reviewer`

### description
- Explain what the agent/skill does
- Include trigger scenarios ("Use when...")
- Keep under 200 characters

### category
- Use one of the existing categories when possible:
  - `infrastructure` - CI/CD, DevOps, deployment, cloud
  - `development` - Frontend, backend, frameworks
  - `quality` - Testing, code review, linting
  - `documentation` - Docs, comments, READMEs
  - `data` - Databases, analytics, data processing

### tags
- Array format: `[tag1, tag2, tag3]`
- Use lowercase, hyphenated tags
- Include 2-5 relevant tags
- Reuse existing tags when applicable

## Example

```yaml
---
name: blue-github-actions-specialist
description: GitHub Actions specialist for CI/CD pipelines and workflow automation. Use when working with .github/workflows or .github/actions.
category: infrastructure
tags: [ci-cd, devops, automation, github]
---
```
