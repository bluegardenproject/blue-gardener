# Examples in agent/subagent/skill prompts

Examples improve quality only when they teach **generalizable structure**, not when they anchor behavior to a specific stack or solution.

## Use examples when they improve general output quality

- Show the **shape of an output** (schemas, checklists, handoff formats, severity labels)
- Demonstrate **edge case handling** patterns (but keep them stack-neutral)
- Illustrate **decision criteria** (how to choose between alternatives)

## Avoid examples that introduce anchoring/bias

- Don’t include a single specific “pet” example (e.g., one library migration) unless the agent/skill is explicitly about that exact tech.
- Don’t bake in framework assumptions (React, Next.js, Node, etc.) unless the scope is explicitly restricted.
- Don’t turn examples into “copy these exact steps” playbooks; keep them illustrative.

## Preferred pattern: templates + variants

- Prefer **parameterized templates** with placeholders (`<SourceLib>`, `<TargetLib>`, `<Framework>`, `<Constraints>`).
- If you include concrete examples, include **2–3 diverse variants** so no single one becomes the default.
- Clearly label examples as **illustrative**, and require the agent to confirm the project context first.

## Keep examples short and isolated

- Keep examples minimal in the main prompt.
- For skills, put detailed examples in `references/` files and refer to them (progressive disclosure).

## Good vs bad

**Bad (anchoring):**

- “Here’s how to migrate Jotai → Redux in our app…” (becomes the default strategy even when irrelevant)

**Good (generalizable):**

- “Migration plan template:\n  - Inventory current state usage\n  - Define target architecture\n  - Create phased rollout + rollback\n  - Execute changes\n  - Run quality gate + tests\n  - Verify acceptance criteria”
